I am an Associate Professor at School of Software in Beihang University (BUAA). Before I joined Beihang, I received the Ph.D. degree at the Advanced Multimedia Research Laboratory in the University of Wollongong, Australia, under the supervision of A/Prof. Wanqing Li and Prof. Philip Ogunbona.

My research is on computer vision and machine learning, with the special interests in open-environment visual learning, visual perception based on pre-trained models, 3D scene understanding, image/3D editing and generation, and multimodal large model agents.

I am looking for self-motivated students for Ph.D./Master degree, please drop me an email if you are interested
